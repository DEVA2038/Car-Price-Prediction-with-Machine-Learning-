✅ Just completed my Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning project!

🚗 I built a model to predict used car prices based on features like year, fuel type, transmission, and more.

🧠 Trained a regression model and performed:

Data preprocessing

Feature engineering

Model evaluation

🛠️ Tools used:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

It was a great hands-on experience in applying machine learning to solve real-world problems.
